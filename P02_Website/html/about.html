    <h2>Live bugs?</h2>
    <p>Yes! Insect Collective is an online insect retailer for hobbyists and exotic pet owners. Insects make for fantastic pets for any person. They are very easy and low maintenance, requiring very little attention. They are also very cost effective pets to have, and low commitment considering the average insect lifespan. Bugs also make for very unique pets and will be a great conversation starter for any home.

  <div class="why">
    <h2>Why insects?</h2>
    <p>Insects all too often get a bad reputation for being creepy, dirty, or dangerous. In reality, itâ€™s not just honeybees and butterflies that are beautiful. Insect Collective offers a wide variety of insects because we believe there is beauty in bugs of all shapes and sizes.

    <p>At Insect Collective, we hope to encourage people to connect with nature and their inner childlike curiosity with the world. The days of collecting bugs in your back yard do not have to be left in the past.
